**Next generation smart tools for AML and KYC**

Going into 2025 we will remain dedicated to focusing on delivering tools and solutions that directly empower our customers, 
specifically by enabling possibilities that were previously out of reach with computationally intensive solutions using GPU power.

<p>We will create very useful tools that where not possible to create a couple of years ago.</p>
First out is a date conversation tool that will help our customers to clean up and sort out quality of large legacy dataset with a breeze. Its a date-conversation tool that doesn't need to know in forehand what its input is.

**Date conversation Tool**

This is a type of solution that will be able to convert almost any kind of date-description to a defined format. 
<p>Here are some examples of dates that it converts to a predefined format YYYY-MM-DD.</p>

<p>The interresting thing with solutions like this are indifference to the input. For example would an easy conversation with different delimiters be very easy to do
  like <b>2022/06/22</b> and <b>20220622</b> would directly convert to <b>2022-06-22</b>. Actually regardless of delimiter it would manage that. But what about more complex examples like <b>twenty second of 6th month in 2021</b>? Yes it handles that resulting in <b>2021-06-22</b>. Or completly different formats like <b>March 5th, '21</b>? Results in <b>2021-03-05</b> and <b>second of july 1970</b> results in <b>1970-07-02</b>. As examples show, the input is not required to follow a specific format.</p>

**No data leaves your network**

So, what can you use a tool like this for? For startes if would be possible to extract dates in a specific format from any kind of text. Or to validate the input or manually entered date field. Or convert fields in large old legacy data-sets. It would be a new tool in the toolbox of data-quality that in the long run would make AML, KYC and Financial Crime Prevention even better.
  
**No data leaves your network**

No AML-tools from Athega requiers energy intesive cloud servers, all are possible to run locally within your network, making sure no infomation leaves.

**Integration is simple**

Batch your data to use the tools over night, or integrate them in your user interfaces, its all up to you. The example below is a simple web client integrating to the Date tool.

**Probabilistic solutions requires less programming and format definitions**

Using a of the shelf small tools minimizes the need for internal tuning. Well defined problems that can be automatically tested.
