**Next generation smart tools for AML and KYC**

Going into 2025 we will remain dedicated to focusing on delivering tools and solutions that directly empower our customers, 
specifically by enabling possibilities that were previously out of reach with computationally intensive solutions using GPU power.

<p>We will create very useful tools that where not possible to create a couple of years ago.</p>
First out is a date conversation tool that will help our customers to clean up and sort out quality of large legacy dataset with a breeze. Its a date-conversation tool that doesn't need to know in forehand what its input is.

**Date conversation Tool**
This is a type of solution that will be able to convert almost any kind of date-description to a defined format. 
<p>Here are some examples of dates that it converts to a predefined format YYYY-MM-DD.</p>
2022/06/22 would be converted to 2022-06-22<br/>
20220622 would be converted to 2022-06-22<br/>
twenty second of 6th month in 2021 would be converted to 2021-06-22<br/>
March 5th, '21 would be converted to 2021-03-05<br/>
second of july 1970 would be converted to 1970-07-02<br/>


**No data leaves your network**

**Integration is simple**
